      Raspberry Pi Serial Port

<http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UmR8suHxt28/UDt0y7qG7GI/AAAAAAAAAGQ/RVjmuOgVv_I/s1600/SerialPrototype.jpg>
Prototyping the serial port interface.

Many of the GPIO pins on the Pi have other special uses.  The most
useful of these are the serial port pins #8 and #10, which are transmit
and receive for an RS-232 serial port.  By default this port will output
diagnostic messages during boot and then provide a user login.  The
configuration is 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no hardware handshaking,
at 115200 baud.  The device name is /dev/ttyAMA0.

I need to use this serial port to interface to my X10 system via a CM11A
computer interface module.  That can be a topic for several future posts.

First lets cover some important facts about RS-232 and voltage levels.
 The Pi uses levels that are 0V to represent a zero and 3.3V to
represent a one.  RS-232 uses -3V to -15V to represent a zero and 3V to
15V to represent a one.  Thus, a level converter is required to create
this interface.  The MAX232 series of chips was designed for this exact
purpose.
<http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jy2v82t7GLE/UDt4Qg_Q4WI/AAAAAAAAAGk/A-plb1aTZug/s1600/RS232.JPG>

External capacitors are needed to drive the charge pumps inside the
chip.  *Note:* There are several variations of the MAX232 chip which
have different requirements.  The one shown in the circuit here uses
0.1uF capacitors.  The ones I have use 1.0uF and some versions even have
the capacitors built in.  When in doubt, check the datasheet for the
chart that shows the requirements for each variation.
Data Sheet for MAX232 family
<http://datasheets.maxim-ic.com/en/ds/MAX220-MAX249.pdf>

If, like me, you want to take complete control of the serial port for
your own uses, there are two configuration changes to make:

First, disable the boot up and diagnostic output to the serial port.
sudo vi /boot/cmdline.txt
and remove the two options referring to the serial port.
So, this
dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=ttyAMA0,115200 kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200
console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait
becomes this
dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4
elevator=deadline rootwait

Second, disable the login prompt
sudo vi /etc/inittab
find the line near the end
T0:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyAMA0 115200 vt100
and delete it or comment it out by putting a # at the start of the line.

Reboot and the serial port will now be free for your exclusive use.

    How can I listen for data on AMA0 in the console without any other
    scripts?

    Need to stop OS from using the serial port as described in the post.
    (Feel free to use nano in place of vi as the editor.)

    Then set baud rate with command like:
    sudo setserial /dev/ttyAMA0 baud_base 9600

    The you could do something as simple as
    cat /dev/ttyAMA0
    and any data from the serial port would echo on the console.
    Hopefully not binary data, and line feeds (or a lack of them) can be
    a problem to readablility.
    Press Ctrl-C to stop

    If you want a full terminal emulator on the console, you could use
    minicom.
    If you are on X you could use gtkterm.

    Hy,

    Could you explain more about the purpose of the capacitors?

    I would use this IC http://sk.fotoarchiefje.nl/Datasheets/max232.pdf

    Does that mean it has built in capacitors and i don't need to use
    extra ones?

    The Raspberry Pi Board

The Raspberry Pi Board <http://www.raspberrypi.org/>
The Raspberry Pi is a credit card sized single-board computer developed
in the UK by the Raspberry Pi Foundation and based on the Broadcom
BCM2835 system on a chip. This US$35 board is intended to stimulate the
teaching of basic computer science in schools. It's also a great item
for hobbyists.

    I'm a long time electronics hobbyist who has taken a great interest
    in the Raspberry Pi board. My main interest is home automation and
    monitoring. I intend to replace the PC based automation system that
    I have now with a RPi based system. This blog will allow me to share
    my experience with other Raspberry Pi enthusiasts.
